# Stupyder.nvim

This is still a WIP but is functional (no promises) and has most features implemented. I'm working on making the config less wonky, adding more default tool options, and a couple of QoL improvements.

**If you encounter an issue**: ~~keep it to yourself~~ Please open a ticket, I'll fix it asap!


Simple markdown code block executor. Stupyder acts as a simple frontend: it passes code block content to a corresponding tool and returns the result, displaying it in a window, as virtual text, or by yanking it to a register. A toolâ€™s configuration can include multiple steps, such as compiling and then running code snippets.

## Why

I've got a couple of niche problems I thought this could solve. Also, it was a good excuse to learn more of the Neovim API. 

**Niche problems**:
* Running README.md example commands/snippets without leaving the README (useful for updating documentation output).
* I write all my notes in markdown files in Neovim, and being able to run snippets/commands in my notes is neat.
* With (self-plug) [brr.nvim](https://github.com/leobeosab), I use it as a REPL in my scratch pad, which saves time if I don't want to run a whole test or project.
  * Or with any other markdown scratch pad like the one in [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim)


## Installation and config

Install with Lazy!

```lua
return {
  dir = "~/proj/stupyder.nvim/",
  cmd = { "Stupyder" },
  config = function ()
    require("stupyder").setup({
      run_options = { print_debug_info = false },
      modes = {
        win = {
          close_shortcut = "q"
        },
        yank = {
          --default
          register = '*'

          --unnamed clipboard
          --register = '"'

          --unnamedplus clipboard
          --register = '+'
        }
      }
    })
  end
}
```

## Modes

Stupyder has multiple "modes," which are just different ways of handling output from stdout and displaying it to the user (or yanking it directly to a register).

### Virtual Text ( default )

Creates virtual text below the code block.
![virtual lines  example](./media/windemo.png)

### Win(dow)

Creates a new window and pumps the output into it.
![win example](./media/virtuallinesdemo.png)

### Yank

Yanks the output to a user-specified register. Check the example config to see the different registers.

### Change default mode

You can set the default mode in the config.

```lua
return {
  dir = "~/proj/stupyder.nvim/",
  cmd = { "Stupyder" },
  config = function ()
    require("stupyder").setup({
      run_options = { default_mode = "virtual_lines" },
    })
  end
}
```

## Tools

Tools are any application into which we want to send a code block's content. Most often, a tool is a compiler or interpreter, but tools like Mermaid or curl could also be used.


### Basic Tool config

To add a new tool, we assign a `command_context` config to the tools table in our config. The index for the tools table matches the language label of the markdown code blocks used with the tool.

**Note:** See CMD / CWD variables documentation for usage in the command and cwd strings.

```lua
local stupyder = require("stupyder")
stupyder.setup({
  run_options = {
    default_mode = "yank"
  }
})
```

### CMD / CWD variables

```
-- TODO: update tmpdir to tmp_dir (I'm sure I'm going to forget)
{tmpdir} = String; path to the temporary directory of the host 
{code_file} = String; filename of temporary code block content file
```
